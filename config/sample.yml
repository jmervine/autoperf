# AutoHTTPerf Configuration File
#
# I've included all possible configurations, some commented.
#
# For detailed descriptions of httperf params, see:
#
# http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/httperf-man-0.9.txt
#
# As for this, it's important to note that if an httperf param has
# a dash ('-') in it, it must be wrapped in quotes, either single
# or double. I use single in my examples below.

## tee
#
# This is an httperf specific option which will force httperf to
# send it's STDOUT to the console as it runs, it defaults to false
#
# tee: true

# The host
server: localhost

# The URI relative to the host root
# - use this without 'wlog'
#uri: /index.html

# The host port
port: 80

# Starting connection rate per second
low_rate: 100

# Highest connection rate per second
high_rate: 500

# Connection rate per second steps
# For the example config:
# [ 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 ]
rate_step: 50

# Run httperf verbose
verbose: true

# Replay file
wlog: 'n,replay_log'

# Total number of connections
'num-conns': 50

# See httperf docs
'num-calls': 1

# See httperf docs
timeout: 5

# add-header adds an HTTP header
# If your test server is using HTTP basic auth, add a header like the following.
# To figure out what it should be use "curl -u user:password -v ..."
#
# 'add-header': '"Authorization: Basic AbC123xYz456==\n"'
